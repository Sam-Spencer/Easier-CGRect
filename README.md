# Easier CGRect
Making `CGRect` play nice with data storage and calculations is annoying. That's fixed with a simple extension.

## Installation

 1. Drag the file into your Xcode project.
 2. That's it. (CocoaPods support soon)
 
## Usage

Directly access `NSNumber` values for `CGRect` properties without needing to write repetitive boilerplate code that converts `origin` and `size` values.

    // Code example coming soon
    
    
Directly access `Float` values for `CGRect` to quickly perform type-safe, value-guaranteed calculation. Again, without needing to write repetitive boilerplate code that converts `origin` and `size` values.
